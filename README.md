# Problems-Solving
Over the course of 2.5 years, I solved more than 1000 programming problems. In this repository, you will find a selection of those problems along with my solutions. These problems were sourced from various courses, books, and problem-solving websites.

## Purpose of This Repository
The purpose of this repository is to showcase my growth as a programmer over the past 2.5 years. It highlights how Iâ€™ve improved my problem-solving skills, tackling various challenges from courses, books, and problem-solving websites. By sharing my solutions, I hope to provide insight into my learning process and demonstrate how my coding approach has evolved. Some of the problems include early solutions that reflect where I started, while others show more advanced techniques as I progressed.

## How to Navigate the Problems
- At the top of each file, you'll find a comment describing the problem and what needs to be achieved.
- Below the comment, you'll see my solution to the problem.

## About the Solutions
- Some of these problems are from my early programming days, so the code might not always be clean or the most optimized solution.
- I used a wide range of technologies to solve these problems.
